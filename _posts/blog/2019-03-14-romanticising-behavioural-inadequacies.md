I can't decide whether I'm being too cynical or too critical, but I happen to notice an increasing use of neurological disorders in people's introductions.  
Phrases like *"Sorry! I'm a Capricorn"*, or *"Sorry, I wasn't listening to you, I have ADHD"* are growing alarmingly common.  
What is funny is this casual acceptance of mental problems is limited only to the individual, as in, they are used more in a defensive stance. Mind you, by **acceptance**, I don't mean **tolerance**, I mean cold-brained obnubilation of logic that enhances self-pity.  
What follows is a discussion of some *trivial behavioural problems* and why humans should be worried about it.

## Depression

Oh! Of course every entitled millennial alive today suffers from depression.<br>
I pity these guys who probably weren't subjected to proper parenting, or lack the emotional intelligence to differentiate between their feelings.
Googling "depression" displays, to my disbelief, "depression quotes" as the first auto-complete suggestion!

And let's save our time and not discuss the emptiness that depression-"quotes" bless the reader with.

## Hangry

The rant continues on for people who are harrowingly rude when they are hungry.<br>
Some genius (most probably on Reddit) coined the word **hangry** and short-tempered ovine mammals all over the globe found an excuse to shield their short-temperedness. What's funny is that these people are perfectly mature to realise that their *hangry-ness* is uncalled for and downright inappropriate. A very common phrase that comes along is:<br>
"I'm sorry for what I said when I was hangry."

Of course, my dear, you are sorry, given the gift of your human brain. But you'll never grow beyond compensating for your choleric behaviour with something as imprudent as the state of being hangry. Just make sure you don't become so angry that you have to turn bulimic.

The upside is that these people can never be anorexic :)

## Introversion

Have you ever come across the typical *"What I Think vs. What I Say"* image and noticed something really strange - the fact that it applies to introverts as much as it does to extroverts, or ambiverts, or nincompoops?<br>
Yet these images are tossed around on the internet as a characteristic of introverts. The terrible consequence is that a lot of people who are inept at effective communication take pride in not being able convey their thoughts, because an activity which the masses aren't skilled at easily becomes a characteristic or a elite personality trait. Then come along those horrendous replies:<br>
"I'm an introvert so I will not be able to enjoy at the party"<br>
or<br>
"I cannot put my thoughts into words because introverts think much faster than they speak."

Introverts using their insecurities proudly as excuses goes against the definition. Most of those people are not introverts, and must stop sugar-coating their morbidly lame social skills. It just means they lack the empathy and the reasoning to understand the differences between extroverts and introverts.<br>


>	"Exasperating farrago of imbecilic, entitled dullards masquerading as shy introverts."
		- wannabe-Shashi-Tharoor, ranting on the bleak understanding of social skillsets.


Many of my friends have accused me of being an impostor in the name of an introvert, most probably because of my habit of chanting sermons.<br>
If I were to condense the conversation from then on, it would reduce to:<br>
"So, do you consider yourself an introvert?"
"Absolutely! But I never underestimate the power of my speech."<br>
Close friends know that I *need some alone-time* to be functional.

Saying what we actually mean is a heavily underrated skill that must be essential to our learning as the only context-aware, semantic conversations we keep up as the only civilised species on Earth right now.<br>
While Shashi Tharoor is a gold-mine of vocabulary, Jordan Peterson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michelle Obama, Ben Shapiro, come off as brilliant examples of how you can say what you think with a limited vocabulary that doesn't make the conversation esoteric.

## Why Should We Be Worried?

I think of words as humans' effort to reveal whatever cocktail is brewing inside their grey matter (obviously, deception can be one of the cocktails).  
By romanticising the inadequacy of projecting thoughts as words, the inadequacy evolves into a characteristic, which is not something that the individual should change, but something that the society should adapt to instead!  
This means humans who are still learning how the world works (also called teenagers) will increasingly get a misdirected, inflated sense of themselves as elite, high functioning humans that under-performing sections of mankind can't understand, comprehend, or relate to. This will quickly turn relationships of the youth (and I don't mean platonic relationships but any acquaintance between two individuals) into **toxic social transactions** that will slowly plague how we as humans communicate with each other.
